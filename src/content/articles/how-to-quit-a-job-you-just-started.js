  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">Started a new job and already thinking about quitting? You're not alone. Sometimes the role, culture, or reality simply doesn't match the offer. The key is to make a thoughtful decision and exit professionally so you protect your reputation and momentum.</p>

  <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-6">Is It Okay to Quit a New Job?</h2>
  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">Yes—if it's the right decision and you handle it professionally. One short stint won't ruin your career. Employers value judgment, honesty, and accountability. That said, consider whether the issue is temporary (normal onboarding friction) or fundamental (deal-breakers).</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-200 mb-4">Questions to ask yourself:</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
      <li>Is this a mismatch in role, culture, or values—or just first-week overwhelm?</li>
      <li>Were expectations changed after I joined (hours, pay, responsibilities)?</li>
      <li>Can the issue be resolved with a conversation or a role tweak?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-4">Rule of thumb: If it's a fixable problem, try to fix it. If it's a deal-breaker, plan a graceful exit.</p>
