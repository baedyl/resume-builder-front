  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">Few interview moments spike adrenaline like hearing, "Why were you fired from your previous job?" Still, with preparation and clarity, this question becomes an open invitation to demonstrate maturity, accountability, and forward-looking focus.</p>

  <div class="grid md:grid-cols-3 gap-6">

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 mb-3">Self-awareness</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 text-base">Interviewers want to see if you can reflect honestly on a difficult situation, name your part in it, and articulate what changed afterward.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg p-6 shadow-sm border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700">
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 mb-3">Integrity check</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 text-base">Dodging details or blaming everyone else raises a red flag. Transparent answers build trust, especially when you offer verifiable steps you took to recover.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg p-6 shadow-sm border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700">
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 mb-3">Fit calibration</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 text-base">The hiring team listens for what you value in a workplace and how you operate. They are deciding if your version of success aligns with theirs now.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-6">Pro tip: jot down the key facts, the catalyst for change, and the professional win that followed. This clarity keeps you grounded when the question pops up without warning.</p>
</div>

<div class="mb-12">
  <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-6">Map Your Answer Framework</h2>
  <div class="bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20 rounded-lg p-6">
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
      <li><strong>Lead with the headline:</strong> Name what happened in one confident sentence. "I was let go after missing back-to-back product deadlines."</li>
      <li><strong>Own your part:</strong> Share the lesson you drew and the behaviors you adjusted. Keep the focus on what you control.</li>
      <li><strong>Show the rebound:</strong> Highlight certifications, projects, or feedback that prove growth since that moment—link it to results.</li>
      <li><strong>Bridge to value:</strong> Land on why you are excited about this role and how your sharper toolkit benefits their team.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mt-6">Practice out loud. Record yourself, refine phrasing, and make sure the emphasis is on your evolution. When in doubt, keep it short, factual, and warm.</p>
</div>

<div class="mb-12">
  <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-6">Example Responses You Can Tailor</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">Use these prompts as inspiration—rewrite them in your voice, connect them to measurable achievements, and rehearse until they sound natural.</p>

  <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
    <li><strong>Time-management pivot:</strong> "My previous company let me go after I underestimated a product launch timeline. The experience pushed me to earn an Agile project certification and implement sprint retros that have since kept my initiatives on track."</li>
    <li><strong>Role fit mismatch:</strong> "I joined a sales-driven culture that prioritized individual quotas over collaboration. After parting ways, I sought environments where cross-functional teamwork is how we win. That shift helped me co-lead a launch that exceeded adoption goals by 40%."</li>
    <li><strong>Communication reset:</strong> "A client deliverable went off course because I assumed requirements instead of confirming them. Since then, I've built a checkpoint system with clients and internal partners that has produced zero escalations across my last six projects."</li>
    <li><strong>Customer empathy upgrade:</strong> "Missing a quarterly target cost me my role, but it surfaced gaps in how I qualified customer needs. I invested in consultative selling workshops and piloted a discovery template that keeps conversion high without pressure tactics."</li>
    <li><strong>Business shift resilience:</strong> "I was part of a reduction in force when my company restructured. I used the time to volunteer with a nonprofit campaign, refine my digital marketing toolkit, and complete a certification that makes me stronger in analytics today."</li>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
      <li><strong>Connect the dots:</strong> If they reference resume gaps, volunteer the short story along with the productive actions you took.</li>
      <li><strong>Reframe transitions:</strong> When talking through your career chronology, emphasize intentional moves, mentorship, and upskilling.</li>
      <li><strong>Bring receipts:</strong> Keep performance reviews, kudos, or metrics handy in a portfolio to reinforce your growth narrative.</li>
    </ul>

  <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mt-6">Interviewers appreciate candidates who anticipate tough moments and stay composed. That calm is often what differentiates finalists.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 mb-2">"What have you done since being fired?"</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">Outline two or three concrete actions: education, consulting engagements, volunteer leadership, or results in your current role. Show that you moved quickly from reflection to action.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg p-6 shadow-sm border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700">
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 mb-2">"Can we talk to your former manager?"</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">Say yes while adding context: "Of course. Our parting was difficult, so I recommend also speaking with my director from the prior program who saw the improvements I implemented." Offering additional references shows maturity.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg p-6 shadow-sm border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700">
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 mb-2">"How do we know it will not happen again?"</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">Tie your answer to systems, not promises: mention the dashboards, rituals, or accountability partners you now rely on. This moves the conversation from past pain to present reliability.</p>
